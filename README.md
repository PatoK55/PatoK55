### Hello, I'm Patrick! 👋

🌍 Originating from Austria, I'm deeply passionate about Machine Learning, with a special focus on Deep Learning and Computer Vision. Currently, I'm working as a Researcher in the field of Data Science at Fraunhofer Austria.

🔍 I'm currently delving into Super Resolution techniques in the area of Remote Sensing, finding it thrilling to push the boundaries of what we can visualize and understand from our data.

🚀 In my free time, I dive into various projects encompassing the sports, finance, and automotive sectors. You can find my work on GitHub under the username **PatoK55**.

🏎️ Fun fact about my username: The '55' is a nod to my admiration for Formula 1 driver Carlos Sainz, known as the "Smooth Operator". Just like him, I aim to be a smooth operator in everything I do.

Check out my projects to learn more about my research and personal pursuits!
